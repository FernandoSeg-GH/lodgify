# Lodgify - Frontend Assessment Requirements:

## Overview:

The widget is composed of:

- A **Progress Bar** indicating the overall completion percentage.
- An **Accordion** for each **group** of tasks.
- A list of **Checkboxes (tasks)** inside each accordion group.

The completion progress is **normalized** according to the sum of all task values. We'll use recude() function to work around the values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 20+ recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FernandoSeg-GH/lodgify.git
   cd lodgify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open the application**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the app running.

**Key components**:

1. **`page.tsx` (Home page)**

   - Fetches task groups via `fetchTasks()` (**server action**).
   - Renders the `ProgressBar` and a list of `Accordion` components, each containing a `TaskGroup`.

2. **`progress-bar.tsx`**

   - Displays a progress bar based on the `progress` prop (0â€“100).

3. **`accordion/index.tsx`**

   - A reusable accordion component that expands/collapses its children.

4. **`tasks/index.tsx` (TaskGroup)**

   - Displays a list of tasks inside a group.

5. **`tasks/task.tsx` (TaskItem)**

   - A single checkbox-like item for marking tasks as checked or unchecked.

6. **`actions.ts`**
   - Exports the `fetchTasks()` function that retrieves task data from the provided URL.

## Challenge:

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ For **Normalised** in this case we mean to reduce a number to its percentage equivalent of the sum of all the values. In Math:

$Nt = Vt * 100 / âˆ‘(Vt)$

where:
$Nt$ is the normalised value of a task
$Vt$ is the scalar value of the task
$âˆ‘(Vt)$ is the sum of all the tasks values.

for example if the sum of the tasks is 423 and a task has a value of 36 the normalised value will be 8.51

</aside>

## Solution:

Instead of displaying the progress by **adding the amount of checked items**, we will display the progress by adding the **value of the checked items**.
In order to 'normalize' to a number, we will use **`reduce()`**, with this function we can transform the data and greatly simplify the reduction to display the progress.
